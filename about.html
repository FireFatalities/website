        <h1 style="color: white; font-family: courier;"><b>Information and Our Purpose</b></h1>
        <h3 style="color: white; font-family: courier; margin: 50px;">Our Shark Tank invention is a fire cloth that can instantly kill fires. Calling our business the "Fire Fatalities," we strive to kill fires before they grasp the lives of innocent civilians. The big idea of this business is to prevent more fires from taking lives. House fires claim a decent amount of lives, making them feared among civilians. The goals of our business is to make a decent profit, solve a real-world problem, and effectively sell our product in the market. Since we are young entrepreneurs, we also want a good amount of satisfaction. <br> <br> <br> The path for our business began when CEO Anish Palleti wanted to address one of the five notions of the Paradigm Challenge. The Paradigm Challenge is a competition that pushes young entrepreneurs to their best and has them make inventions that solve one of five problems (Home Fires, Waste Reduction, Personal Health, Food Security, and Biodiversity). Thus, Anish thought of an invention that could kill fires and save lives. That is when the Fire Cloth came into inception. The "Fire-cloth" acts like a rag on the outside and contains a fire-killing material on the inside. After the awakening of this idea, our CFO Eshaan and CMO Ayush made it a point to effectively advertise our product and sell our product at a reasonable price. COO Aditya wants to make sure everything is running smoothly and safely. <br> <br> <br> Our cloth not only functions as an item to kill fires, but it can act as a regular cloth before being used to kill a fire. By making a way to smother fires using something that is also a household item, we can have multipurpose items. Multipurpose items are useful in today's fast-paced world because people don't have time to do things separately, while still remembering how to use a fire extinguisher for example, in an extremely dangerous situation like small house fires. Other solutions to kill fires are inefficient, time-consuming, and sometimes complicated to use. By creating a fire cloth, we can combine efficiency, time management, and easy handling into one product. House fires are a huge problem, so investors might want to help solve this problem. In addition, a lot of people buy normal rags, so there is no harm in buying ours that also prevents fires from becoming strong enough to be destructive. <br> <br> <br> The fire cloth is currently only in once size at the moment. It costs us about $6 to manufacture it and we are charging $12.49 for each fire cloth, so we are making about $6.50 in profit.</h3>
